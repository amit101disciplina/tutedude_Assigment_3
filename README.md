# tutedude_Assigment_3
Assignment 3 of tutedude's python course
This repository contains solutions for Task 1 and Task 2 of Assignment 3.

## Task 1: [Calculate Factorial Using a Function]
This script (`Task1.py`) performs the following functionality:
- It takes input of a number as n, then in the next line it enters the function "factorial(n)".
- In the function if the number is 0 or 1 it returns 1 as the value, if number is 2 or greater it enters the else statement and returns "n*factorial(n-1)", this calculates the factorial of the number.
- factorial(n) is assigned to result, factorial of the number is printed on the console using print statement.
- Example -
  if we enter number as 5.
  we get Output as "Factorial of 5 is: 120"
  (or)
  if we enter number as 1.
  we get Output as "Factorial of 1 is: 1"

## Task 2: [Using the Math Module for Calculations]
This script (`Task2.py`) performs the following functionality:
- In this program we use math module in python to do some calculations.
- We imported all functions of math library in python in first line using "*".
- It takes the input of a number from the user.
- in next three lines, we use sqrt() function for square root, log() function to find Logarithm and sin() function to find Sine value.
- Example-
  if we give input number as 25.
  we get Output as:
  Square root: 5.0
  Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
  Sine: -0.13235175009777303
